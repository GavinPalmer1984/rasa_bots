# overview

One goal is to build a tool for managing personal social media effectively.  We hope to help solve the most important problem in the world: people being unable to identify signals from the noise.

- produce content across many social media networks with the source of truth existing in version control
- crawl responses to social media posts in order to identify signals from the noise

# rasa_bots

In order to minimize costs, we could schedule the bot to run once per hour.  It can import conversations which have happened and respond to them.
